Spoilers.

Wow,what a fucking great anime this one.So good that I had the urge to write things about it here.First of all art is easy 10/10 for me. Since I like bright colors
the art was really easy to enjoy.The story was slow at first but processed greatly towards the end.Since I'm one the people that roots for a character in romance animes
I was quiet happy at the end.From the start Hikari was pretty annoying.I dont like straightforward people so I liked Tsumugu a lot.Same goes for Manaka.

I was pretty convinced that Tsumugu and Chisaki is a no-no but I hoped anyway.The second arc when time lapsed happened and we saw Tsumugu and Chisaki was living together for **5 FUCKING years**
I said that,yeah we will win!! Despite they did a pretty good job convincing us that Manaka is in love with Tsumugu(at least I was convinced), the plot twist at the end was pretty good.
Of course,you feel sad for the ones that dont get to be happy in the end.**Miuna** was a really good character and made the story progress a lot.I liked the character design a lot too.

The pentagon aside, *Shioshishio* was really good art wise.

I'm definitely rewatching this in the future.
