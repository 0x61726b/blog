I'm going to try my hand on Global Illumination and screen-space reflections with Yume Engine. Now this topic is no joke,very hard.Crazy math involved.Hopefully I can pull this off
because I want to do GI and SSR very bad.I'm gonna read every possible paper in the next days/weeks/months and try my best do implement what I learn.

The papers I'm *hoping* to read.

[Global Illumination](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/Courses/2003/Intro.fall.03/slides/global_web/global.pdf)  
[Gamedev thread about SSR](http://www.gamedev.net/topic/658702-help-with-gpu-pro-5-hi-z-screen-space-reflections/)

And many more not in my mind right now..
