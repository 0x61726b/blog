Uh,this season was really great in terms of variety of shows aired especially ones that my all time favourites.As a fan of music genre in anime I really enjoyed this season.Below I will go through my top 3 list of anime that I liked the most this season.

## Hibike! Euphonium

It's like KyoAni has a relationship with viewers.Most of the time it was a rollercoaster(those yuri baits).We all knew it wasnt going to happen but we believed it anyway..It's a great show if you especially like music.

## Oregairu

The second season of the show.Might need to rewatch..I can't possibly explain this anime in a 1-2 sentence.Probably the best romance/comedy combo.

## Shokugeki no Souma

So much plot actually.This is one of my absolute favourites.Food orgasms each episode and its very fun.You can't possibly get bored when watching this show.

There's much many to say but I wont bother writing reviews,DUH.Others I liked are:


## Plastic Memories

This was very sad..It was obvious from the first episode what will happen at the end but I still hoped for a non-bitter ending..

## Ore Monogatari

Takeo FTW!


## DanMachi
