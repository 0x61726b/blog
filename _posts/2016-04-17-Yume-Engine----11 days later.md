After [this](http://arkenthera.github.io/Yume-Engine-Poor-Men's-Cornell-Box/) post I have worked really hard to achieve Light Propagations Volume using [this](http://cg.ivd.kit.edu/publications/p2010/CLPVFRII_Kaplanyan_2010/CLPVFRII_Kaplanyan_2010.pdf) paper. It was the hardest thing I've done in my life for sure.Its still not perfect,there are some problems,little errors but I got the same image as in the paper! Here are some screens.
