## Haganai Ending

I was hyped for Hagani Next but ended up liking the first season more,despite Next's art is obviously better.It is just my thoughts but,I already hate dense MCs such as Aniki.
But Aniki is not actually dense.But he forces himself to be dense..Hm.I understand he doesnt want to mess up the club by getting a girlfriend from one of the girls.He says he likes to give a happy
ending to everybody but he can't.Thats very understandable.I still wanted him to end up with someone though..It was painful watching 24 episodes where he constantly turns down all of them..
I sometime will go read manga,i think currently there are 3 more volumes after the anime so its not that long..Despite all this,it is a great show,must watch!!
