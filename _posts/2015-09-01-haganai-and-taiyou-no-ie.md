So I've started watching <a href='http://myanimelist.net/anime/10719/Boku_wa_Tomodachi_ga_Sukunai'>Haganai</a> last week and it's been great.Now I'm moving onto the sequel which seems even better.
Artstyle looks improved and (i'm at first episode) the scent of the show looks same and entertaining!

I dont want to finish this show because its very fun!But oh well I gotta watch it anyways..
From a friend recommendation I've started reading <a href='https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=52772'>Taiyou no Ie</a>. I like Shoujo so it's going fine right now.This is my second Shoujo(i think)
,with the first being Aoharaido.Artstyle seems similar to Last Game,the artist isnt the same though.

It's not very long so I expect to finish it in 2-3 days.Most of the time I only read at nights for a ~2 hours so it takes a lot time to progress..

Oh also I was waiting for Grisaia no Rakuen BDs to release for a long time..So it seems the first 2 episodes is out finally.Gotta go watch without lightrays!
